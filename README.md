# MessingAroundW-Cryptography
## My favorite practical exercise from 4 years of Uni

These programs simply generate keypairs for RSA use, encrypt a One Line Message with an author and decrypt an encrypted message.
Code works fine on Netbeans8.2 with all expected results. However, when used via command line, encryptMessage and decryptMessage
throw exceptions I can't be bothered to look into rn.
Updated NetbeansProject as well on a zip file for those interested.
